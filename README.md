# SSDL

This repository contains scripts for decoding emotion states from intracranial neural activity.

This repository hosts the code for the following manuscript: Cross-task, explainable, and real-time decoding of human emotion states by integrating grey and white matter intracranial neural activity.

# Code structure

We developed the self-supervised deep learning models that achieved fine-grained decoding of continuous valence and arousal values.

The model fitting, prediction and evaluation scripts are included under [./model](./model)
